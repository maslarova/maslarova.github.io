 Welcome! My name is Dominika Maslarova. I am a PhD student of Physical Engineering at the Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering.
I have been simultaneously working as a researcher at the Institute of Plasma Physics of Czech Academy of Sciences.
My research interests include laser-driven plasma-based particle accelerators and radiation sources. I have experience with performing kinetic numerical simulations on large-scale HPC supercomputers.
