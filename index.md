 Welcome! My name is Dominika Maslarova. I am a PhD student of Physical Engineering at the Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering.
I have been simultaneously working as a researcher at the Institute of Plasma Physics of Czech Academy of Sciences.
My research interests include laser-driven plasma-based particle accelerators and radiation sources. I have experience with performing kinetic numerical simulations on large-scale HPC supercomputers.

Research highlights:
  - <b>Creation and generation with next-generation multi-PW laser pulses</b>
  - <strong>When a plasma grid kicks the electrons</strong>
    Laser wakefield electron accelerators represent a promising concept of the next-generation accelerators. Their main advantage is a remarkably short acceleration length, caused by a significant acceleration gradient (up to ~100 GV/m), about thousand-fold times higher than in the conventional radiofrequency accelerators.
In order to be accelerated, electrons need addition preacceleration “stage” similarly as in the conventional device. In this research, we analyzed a collision of two ultrashort laser pulses under 10 degree angle colliding in a gas plasma jet. The high intensity of the laser pulses caused immediate atom ionization. Electrons were consequently freely moving at the area of the laser pulses. The pulses created "stripes" of light due to the interference. This phenomenon led to the separation of plasma electrons in plasmas, creating a relativistic electron grid. Some electrons moved in the spare areas of the grid, gaining extra energy. These preaccelerated electrons were then trapped in the wakefield plasma waves created by the laser pulses 
The simulations results were proven experimentally by the group of professor Donald Umstadter at Extreme Light Laboratory of University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
